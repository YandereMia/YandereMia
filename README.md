# 👤 About Me

Hi, I'm **Mia** – a passionate self-taught developer and creator of **[TermOS](https://github.com/Maty12CzSk/TermOS4.0)** – a minimalist operating system built entirely from scratch in C and Assembly.  
I love digging deep into low-level programming, operating systems, and building tools that feel raw and close to the metal.

## 🌱 My Philosophy

- I believe in building things from the ground up — no shortcuts, no dependencies if I can help it.
- I love helping people. I’ve been that “therapist friend” to many, and my mission is to make a difference — whether with code or empathy.
- I’d rather spend 22 hours straight building something real than talk about it for a week.
